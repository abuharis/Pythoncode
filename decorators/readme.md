## A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are typically applied to functions, and they play a crucial role in enhancing or modifying the behavior of functions. Traditionally, decorators are placed before the definition of a function you want to decorate.

### Usage
`@decorator`
`function()`

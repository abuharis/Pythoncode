A Framework typically provides a structured way to start a project by offering a predefined folder and file organization, essential libraries, and 
sometimes built-in functionalities. It helps developers follow best practices, maintain code consistency, and speed up development.
A framework usually includes:
1. Folder Structure
2. Core Files
3. Built-in Features
    Authentication and Authorization
    Database Integration
    Middleware
    Routing
    Templates
    Static Files
    API Handling
    Caching mechanisms

What is Django?
Django is a high-level, full-stack web framework written in Python that follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture. 
It is designed to help developers build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications quickly by providing built-in features such as 
authentication, database management, and admin interfaces.

Key Philosophy of Django:

"Batteries included" - Comes with a wide range of built-in features.
Focus on rapid development with clean and pragmatic design.
Strong security features by default.

#Key Features of Django That Differentiate It from Flask:
Admin Interface:

Django provides an automatically generated admin panel to manage application data without extra coding.
Flask does not include an admin panel by default.
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):

Django comes with a powerful ORM that handles database operations via Python models.
Flask requires manual integration with libraries like SQLAlchemy.
Security:

Django includes built-in protection against CSRF, XSS, and SQL injection attacks.
Flask provides security but needs additional configuration.
Form Handling:

Django Forms manage form validation and input processing.
Flask needs extensions like Flask-WTF for similar functionality.
Authentication & Authorization:

Django provides ready-to-use authentication (login/logout, permissions, and user groups).
Flask requires Flask-Login and Flask-Principal for similar functionality.
Scalability:

Django is ideal for large applications due to its modular structure and built-in features.
Flask is better suited for microservices or small applications.
When to Choose Django vs. Flask?
Choose Django when:

You need a full-featured framework with everything included.
Your project requires complex features like authentication, ORM, and an admin panel.
Security and scalability are priorities.
You want rapid development with minimal setup.
Choose Flask when:

You need a lightweight and flexible framework.
Your project is small or requires microservices.
You prefer to pick and choose external libraries as needed.
You want full control over project structure and components.
